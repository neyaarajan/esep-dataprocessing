## How to Run Code
My code was done in C++, so I used the CLion IDE to right my code. If you have CLion, use these instructions:
1. Create new project in CLion and name it "DataProcessing", set the standard to C++14.
2. Go into Github, copy entirety of the main.cpp code.
3. Clear boilerplate main.cpp in C++ project and paste the github code.
4. Hit the run button in corner and it should display results.

Results will run the commands given in the document and will return what it should (when need to return null, I returned -1)

If you do not have C++, use Replit and follow these instructions:
1. Open a Replit account if you don't already have one.
2. In top-left corner, click create repl.
3. Choose C++ as the template and create.
4. Replace main.cpp boilerplate code with the main.cpp code in the Github.
5. Hit the run button on the top and it should display results.

Results will run the commands given in the document and will return what it should (when need to return null, I returned -1)

## Assignment Modification
I think the way of turning in the assignment should be improved. This assignment should follow the same format we used for the React or Automated Testing assignment where boilerplate code was given and we filled it in. In this case, we would implement the empty functions and make sure the code in main works. It just gives more structure and the student doesn't have to be worried that their code won't run on the grader's end even if it worked for them.

**For graders, if you would like to test out your own commands , just edit the main. Right now it is just running the commands that were given in Figure 2 of the assignment document**
